# NonsensePad

## Description

A simple, playful project for amusement, exploration, and learning.
I created NonsensePad during self-study of JS, HTML, and CSS prior to any formal learning.

The premise of the app is to have musical image pads that can be played much like sampler buttons but the image pads are responsive to mouse hover and so the pad layout is changing dyanmically making it intentionally difficult to play. The app is intended to be a fun way to explore the DOM, event listeners, and CSS.

## Installation

Clone the repository and open index.html in your browser, `open index.html`.

## Usage

Open and play.
